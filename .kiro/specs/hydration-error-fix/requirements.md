# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the React hydration error occurring in the CalmNest application where server-rendered content does not match client-rendered content, specifically affecting the GuidedBreathingPage component where text content changes from "Quick Relief Exercises" to "Breathing & Sleep Techniques".

## Glossary

- **Hydration Error**: A React error that occurs when the server-rendered HTML doesn't match the client-side rendered content
- **CalmNest Application**: The Next.js mental health and wellness application
- **GuidedBreathingPage**: The React component experiencing the hydration mismatch
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: The process of rendering React components on the server before sending to client
- **Client-Side Rendering (CSR)**: The process of rendering React components in the browser

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user visiting the guided breathing page, I want the page to load without hydration errors, so that I have a smooth and consistent experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the GuidedBreathingPage component renders, THE CalmNest Application SHALL display consistent text content between server and client rendering
2. THE CalmNest Application SHALL eliminate the hydration error "Text content does not match server-rendered HTML"
3. WHEN the page loads, THE CalmNest Application SHALL show the same heading text on both server and client renders
4. THE CalmNest Application SHALL maintain proper React component lifecycle without hydration warnings
5. WHEN users navigate to the guided breathing page, THE CalmNest Application SHALL render without console errors related to hydration

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the application, I want to identify and fix the root cause of dynamic content rendering, so that similar hydration issues are prevented in the future.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE CalmNest Application SHALL use consistent data sources for text content during server and client rendering
2. WHEN conditional rendering is used, THE CalmNest Application SHALL ensure the same conditions apply on both server and client
3. THE CalmNest Application SHALL implement proper handling of dynamic content that may differ between server and client environments
4. WHEN state-dependent content is rendered, THE CalmNest Application SHALL use appropriate React patterns to prevent hydration mismatches
5. THE CalmNest Application SHALL validate that all text content sources are deterministic across rendering environments

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want to verify that the hydration fix doesn't break existing functionality, so that the application remains stable and functional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the hydration fix is applied, THE CalmNest Application SHALL maintain all existing breathing exercise functionality
2. THE CalmNest Application SHALL preserve the correct final text content ("Breathing & Sleep Techniques") after the fix
3. WHEN users interact with the guided breathing features, THE CalmNest Application SHALL respond correctly without regression
4. THE CalmNest Application SHALL maintain proper navigation and routing to the GuidedBreathingPage
5. WHEN the application builds and deploys, THE CalmNest Application SHALL complete without hydration-related build warnings
