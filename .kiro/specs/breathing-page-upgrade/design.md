## Error Handling

### 1. Data Loading States

**Strategy**: Implement skeleton loading and graceful degradation
- Show skeleton cards while exercises load
- Display cached data when offline
- Provide retry mechanisms for failed requests

### 2. User Preference Sync

**Strategy**: Local storage backup with cloud sync
- Store preferences locally for immediate access
- Sync with backend when available
- Handle conflicts with user choice dialog

### 3. Exercise Playback Issues

**Strategy**: Fallback options and error recovery
- Provide alternative exercise formats
- Cache critical exercise data locally
- Show helpful error messages with solutions

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Component Testing

**Approach**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests
- Test all interactive elements and state changes
- Verify accessibility compliance
- Test responsive design breakpoints

**Test Cases:**
- Filter functionality works correctly
- Exercise cards display proper information
- Progress tracking updates accurately
- Recommendations are relevant and functional

### 2. User Experience Testing

**Approach**: Usability testing and performance monitoring
- Test exercise flow from discovery to completion
- Verify smooth animations and transitions
- Measure loading times and responsiveness

**Metrics:**
- Time to find and start an exercise
- User engagement with new features
- Exercise completion rates
- User satisfaction scores

### 3. Performance Testing

**Approach**: Load testing and optimization validation
- Test with large exercise libraries
- Verify smooth scrolling and animations
- Monitor memory usage during long sessions

**Benchmarks:**

## Technical Decisions and Rationales

### Decision 1: Component Architecture
**Choice**: Modular component design with clear separation of concerns
**Rationale**: Enables easier testing, maintenance, and future feature additions

### Decision 2: State Management
**Choice**: React Context with useReducer for complex state
**Rationale**: Provides predictable state updates while avoiding over-engineering with external libraries

### Decision 3: Animation Library
**Choice**: Framer Motion for animations and transitions
**Rationale**: Already used in the project, provides smooth animations with good performance

### Decision 4: Data Persistence
**Choice**: Combination of localStorage and backend sync
**Rationale**: Ensures immediate responsiveness while maintaining data across devices

### Decision 5: Accessibility
**Choice**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with keyboard navigation
**Rationale**: Ensures the application is usable by all users, including those with disabilities
