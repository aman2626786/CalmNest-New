# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for redesigning the breathing feature in the CalmNest mental health application. The current implementation has hydration issues and interface problems that require a complete redesign to provide users with an effective, accessible breathing exercise experience.

## Glossary

- **Breathing_System**: The complete breathing exercise feature including UI, animations, and user interactions
- **Exercise_Session**: A single breathing exercise session with defined duration and pattern
- **Breathing_Pattern**: The inhale/exhale timing configuration (e.g., 4-7-8 breathing)
- **Session_State**: The current state of a breathing exercise (idle, active, paused, completed)
- **User_Interface**: The visual components that users interact with during breathing exercises
- **Animation_Engine**: The visual and audio feedback system that guides breathing timing

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user experiencing stress or anxiety, I want to access breathing exercises easily, so that I can quickly start a calming session.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the breathing section, THE Breathing_System SHALL display available breathing exercises within 2 seconds
2. THE Breathing_System SHALL provide at least 3 different breathing patterns (4-4-4, 4-7-8, and box breathing)
3. WHEN a user selects a breathing pattern, THE Breathing_System SHALL start the exercise within 1 second
4. THE User_Interface SHALL be accessible on both desktop and mobile devices
5. THE Breathing_System SHALL work without requiring any external dependencies or internet connection

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user doing breathing exercises, I want clear visual and audio guidance, so that I can follow the breathing pattern correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHILE an Exercise_Session is active, THE Animation_Engine SHALL provide smooth visual breathing cues
2. WHEN the inhale phase begins, THE Animation_Engine SHALL display expanding visual indicators for the specified duration
3. WHEN the hold phase begins, THE Animation_Engine SHALL maintain static visual indicators for the specified duration
4. WHEN the exhale phase begins, THE Animation_Engine SHALL display contracting visual indicators for the specified duration
5. THE Animation_Engine SHALL provide optional audio cues synchronized with visual indicators

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to control my breathing session, so that I can customize the experience to my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHILE an Exercise_Session is active, THE Breathing_System SHALL allow users to pause the session
2. WHILE an Exercise_Session is paused, THE Breathing_System SHALL allow users to resume the session
3. THE Breathing_System SHALL allow users to stop a session at any time
4. THE Breathing_System SHALL allow users to adjust session duration before starting
5. WHERE audio is enabled, THE Breathing_System SHALL allow users to toggle audio cues on/off

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the breathing feature to work reliably across different devices and browsers, so that I can access it whenever I need it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Breathing_System SHALL render consistently between server and client to prevent hydration errors
2. THE User_Interface SHALL be responsive and work on screen sizes from 320px to 1920px width
3. THE Animation_Engine SHALL perform smoothly at 60fps on modern browsers
4. THE Breathing_System SHALL gracefully handle browser tab switching and focus changes
5. THE Breathing_System SHALL maintain session state when users navigate away and return

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to track my breathing exercise progress, so that I can see my consistency and improvement over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes an Exercise_Session, THE Breathing_System SHALL record the session completion
2. THE Breathing_System SHALL display total sessions completed in the current week
3. THE Breathing_System SHALL show the user's preferred breathing pattern based on usage
4. THE Breathing_System SHALL store session data locally to protect user privacy
5. WHERE a user has completed multiple sessions, THE Breathing_System SHALL display a simple progress indicator
