# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The dashboard is currently failing to load due to a 500 Internal Server Error from the Flask backend API endpoint `/api/dashboard/unified/{user_id}/{email}`. The error indicates a `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'isoformat'` issue, suggesting that the backend is trying to format a None/null date value. This feature specification addresses fixing the dashboard data loading and error handling to ensure users can access their dashboard reliably.

## Glossary

- **Dashboard_System**: The web application's main dashboard interface that displays user data
- **Flask_Backend**: The Python Flask server that provides API endpoints for the frontend
- **Unified_API**: The specific API endpoint `/api/dashboard/unified/{user_id}/{email}` that aggregates dashboard data
- **Frontend_Client**: The Next.js React application that consumes the dashboard API
- **Error_Handler**: The system component responsible for managing and displaying error states

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access my dashboard without encountering server errors, so that I can view my data and use the application effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the dashboard, THE Dashboard_System SHALL load successfully without 500 errors
2. WHEN the Unified_API processes user data, THE Flask_Backend SHALL handle null date values without throwing exceptions
3. IF a date field is null or None, THEN THE Flask_Backend SHALL provide a default value or skip the isoformat operation
4. WHEN dashboard data is requested, THE Unified_API SHALL return a valid JSON response with status 200
5. WHILE processing user data, THE Flask_Backend SHALL validate data integrity before attempting date formatting operations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see meaningful error messages when something goes wrong, so that I understand what happened and can take appropriate action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Unified_API encounters an error, THE Error_Handler SHALL log detailed error information for debugging
2. IF the backend cannot process the request, THEN THE Frontend_Client SHALL display a user-friendly error message
3. WHEN a 500 error occurs, THE Dashboard_System SHALL provide fallback content or retry options
4. WHILE handling errors, THE Error_Handler SHALL not expose sensitive system information to users
5. WHERE error recovery is possible, THE Dashboard_System SHALL attempt automatic retry with exponential backoff

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust error handling and logging in the dashboard API, so that I can quickly identify and fix issues when they occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing dashboard requests, THE Flask_Backend SHALL validate all required data before processing
2. IF any data field is missing or invalid, THEN THE Unified_API SHALL return appropriate error codes with descriptive messages
3. WHEN errors occur, THE Flask_Backend SHALL log stack traces and request context for debugging
4. WHILE handling date operations, THE Flask_Backend SHALL check for null values before calling isoformat methods
5. WHERE data inconsistencies exist, THE Unified_API SHALL handle them gracefully without crashing
