# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Complete Mental Health Assessment feature needs to be redesigned as a complete end-to-end solution that works without requiring a separate backend server. The current implementation depends on a Flask backend that may not be running, causing the assessment to fail. The new solution should store data locally/in the database and redirect users to the dashboard upon completion.
