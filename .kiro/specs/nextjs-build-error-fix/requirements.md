# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses a critical build error in the Next.js application where metadata export conflicts with the "use client" directive in the root layout component. The error prevents successful compilation and deployment of the application.

## Glossary

- **Next.js Application**: The React-based web application framework being used for the CalmNest project
- **Root Layout Component**: The main layout component (layout.tsx) that wraps all pages in the application
- **Client Component**: A React component marked with "use client" directive that runs in the browser
- **Server Component**: A React component that runs on the server and can export metadata
- **Metadata Export**: Next.js feature for defining page metadata like title and description
- **Build Process**: The compilation process that converts source code into production-ready assets

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Next.js application to build successfully, so that I can deploy the application without compilation errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build process runs, THE Next.js Application SHALL compile without errors
2. THE Root Layout Component SHALL NOT export metadata while marked as a client component
3. THE Next.js Application SHALL maintain proper metadata configuration for SEO purposes
4. THE Root Layout Component SHALL preserve all existing functionality after the fix

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper metadata handling in the application, so that SEO and social sharing work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Next.js Application SHALL display the correct page title in browser tabs
2. THE Next.js Application SHALL provide proper meta descriptions for search engines
3. WHERE metadata is required, THE Next.js Application SHALL export metadata from appropriate server components
4. THE Root Layout Component SHALL maintain consistent metadata structure across the application

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the client-side functionality to work properly, so that interactive features continue to function as expected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Root Layout Component SHALL maintain all client-side providers and context
2. THE Root Layout Component SHALL preserve theme switching functionality
3. THE Root Layout Component SHALL maintain session management capabilities
4. WHEN the component renders, THE Root Layout Component SHALL initialize all required client-side features
