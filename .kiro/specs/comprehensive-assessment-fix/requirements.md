# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Complete Mental Health Assessment feature exists in the codebase but has critical bugs preventing it from functioning properly. The main issue is an incorrect authentication hook usage that causes the assessment session page to fail. This feature needs to be fixed to restore full functionality for users wanting to complete comprehensive mental health assessments.
