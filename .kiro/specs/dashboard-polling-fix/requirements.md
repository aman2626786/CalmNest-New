# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The dashboard is experiencing continuous API polling where the same API endpoint is being called repeatedly in a loop, causing performance issues and unnecessary server load. The logs show the dashboard API being called multiple times per second with the same user email, indicating a React useEffect dependency issue that's causing infinite re-renders and API calls.

## Glossary

- **Dashboard_Component**: The React component that displays user mental health data and analytics
- **API_Polling**: The repeated calling of the same API endpoint without proper state management
- **UseEffect_Hook**: The React hook responsible for managing side effects and API calls
- **Dependency_Array**: The array of dependencies that determines when useEffect should re-run
- **State_Management**: The proper handling of component state to prevent unnecessary re-renders

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the dashboard to load my data once without continuous API calls, so that the application performs efficiently and doesn't waste server resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard component mounts, THE Dashboard_Component SHALL make exactly one API call to fetch user data
2. WHEN the API call completes successfully, THE Dashboard_Component SHALL not make additional API calls unless explicitly triggered
3. WHEN the user data is already loaded, THE Dashboard_Component SHALL not refetch the same data automatically
4. WHILE the dashboard is displayed, THE API_Polling SHALL not occur without user interaction
5. IF the user refreshes the page, THEN THE Dashboard_Component SHALL make only one new API call

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper React state management in the dashboard component, so that useEffect hooks don't cause infinite re-render loops.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the fetchDashboardData function is defined, THE UseEffect_Hook SHALL have stable dependencies that don't change on every render
2. WHEN the component re-renders, THE fetchDashboardData function SHALL not be recreated unnecessarily
3. WHEN the isDataFetched state is true, THE UseEffect_Hook SHALL not trigger additional API calls
4. WHILE managing component state, THE State_Management SHALL prevent circular dependencies in useEffect
5. WHERE useCallback is used, THE Dependency_Array SHALL only include values that actually need to trigger re-execution

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the dashboard to handle loading states properly, so that I see appropriate feedback while data is being fetched.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard starts loading, THE Dashboard_Component SHALL display a loading indicator
2. WHEN the API call is in progress, THE Dashboard_Component SHALL prevent additional API calls
3. WHEN data loading completes, THE Dashboard_Component SHALL hide the loading indicator and display the data
4. IF an error occurs during loading, THEN THE Dashboard_Component SHALL display an error message with retry option
5. WHEN the retry button is clicked, THE Dashboard_Component SHALL make exactly one new API call

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to see clean server logs without repetitive API calls, so that I can monitor the application effectively and identify real issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the dashboard, THE Dashboard_Component SHALL generate only necessary log entries
2. WHEN the API call succeeds, THE Dashboard_Component SHALL log the success once per session
3. WHEN monitoring server logs, THE API_Polling SHALL not create spam or repetitive entries
4. WHILE the dashboard is active, THE Dashboard_Component SHALL not continuously log the same API calls
5. WHERE debugging is needed, THE Dashboard_Component SHALL provide meaningful log messages without repetition
