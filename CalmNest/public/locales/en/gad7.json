      "title": "Minimal Anxiety",
      "summary": "This indicates little to no anxiety symptoms. You probably feel generally calm and able to cope with stress.",
      "points": [
        "Enjoy wellness practices. Keep doing things that make you feel relaxed – regular exercise, hobbies, social activities – to maintain this balance.",
        "Preventative self-care. Even if anxiety is low, continue healthy habits: enough sleep, balanced meals, and some physical activity (e.g. a daily walk) help your mind stay steady.",
        "Mindfulness and relaxation. Short practices like deep breathing or progressive muscle relaxation can keep mild worries from growing. Apps like MindShift CBT (focused on anxiety) can introduce these techniques in a friendly way.",
        "Connect with others. Keep talking with friends and family about daily stresses. Sharing even small worries can prevent them from building up later.",
        "Stay aware. Continue to check in with yourself. If you start to notice more frequent worries or tension, use self-help tools or consider whether some extra support (like an online therapy course) might help."
      ]
    },
    "mild": {
      "title": "Mild Anxiety",
      "summary": "Mild anxiety means you feel some tension or worry, but it isn’t overwhelming. These symptoms are generally manageable and often improve with simple strategies.",
      "points": [
        "Lifestyle adjustments. Practice stress-relief activities: for example, set aside time for light exercise (even short walks help), regular sleep routines, and hobbies you enjoy. Reducing caffeine or alcohol can also help keep anxiety lower.",
        "Stress-management techniques. Incorporate relaxation into your day – try guided imagery, short meditation breaks, or gentle yoga. Even a few minutes of deep breathing when stressed can calm your nervous system.",
        "Support and talk. Discuss your feelings with someone you trust. You might also try anonymous peer support (forums, chat groups) for people managing anxiety.",
        "Helpful apps/resources. Use apps designed for mild anxiety: Sanvello, Happify, or MindShift CBT offer exercises in CBT and coping strategies. These can teach you to challenge anxious thoughts in a user-friendly way.",
        "Monitor symptoms. Keep an eye on your anxiety level. If worries start to interfere more with work or social life, it’s time to step up care (e.g. schedule a check-in with a counselor)."
      ]
    },
    "moderate": {
      "title": "Moderate Anxiety",
      "summary": "This score means anxiety is more noticeable and may begin to interfere with routines. You might feel restless, have trouble concentrating, or avoid some triggers.",
      "points": [
        "Try structured strategies. Learning simple CBT techniques can help. For example, write down anxious thoughts and question them (“Is this worry realistic?”). Many people find that challenging fear-based thoughts eases anxiety over time.",
        "Relaxation practice. Make daily relaxation a habit. Progressive muscle relaxation, mindfulness meditation, or listening to calming music for 10–15 minutes can significantly reduce tension.",
        "Stay active. Regular physical activity (like jogging, cycling, or a dance class) releases endorphins and combats anxiety. Even mild exercise several times a week can make a big difference.",
        "Seek professional help if needed. If anxiety is persistent and affecting daily life (sleep, relationships, work), consider talking to a therapist. CBT therapy or even an online counseling session can teach you tailored coping skills.",
        "Use support tools. Continue using helpful apps (e.g. anxiety-management or meditation apps). Consider brief self-help programs – for instance, an online CBT course – to guide you through anxiety management exercises step by step."

    },
    "severe": {
      "title": "Severe Anxiety",
      "summary": "A severe score indicates that anxiety is significantly disrupting your life. Urgent attention is important.",
      "points": [
        "Get professional care. Seek help promptly from a mental health professional (therapist or psychiatrist). You may benefit from a formal treatment plan combining therapy and possibly medication. Early treatment often leads to better outcomes.",
        "Safety plan. If anxiety causes panic attacks or thoughts of harm, create a coping plan. Identify what helps you calm down (a friend to call, a quiet room, emergency breathing techniques) and have crisis numbers (like 988 in the US) handy.",
        "Lifestyle changes. Pay extra attention to daily habits: aim for consistent 7–9 hours of sleep, reduce stimulants (caffeine, sugar), and eat regular nutritious meals. Gentle movement (yoga, tai chi, or stretching) can relieve physical tension.",
        "Support network. Tell close friends/family about your anxiety level so they can support you. Sometimes even having someone walk beside you when feeling anxious (for example, in a busy place) can help. Consider joining a more structured support group or workshop for anxiety.",
        "Intensive strategies. If standard self-help isn’t enough, look into more intensive programs. This could include daily mindfulness practice, attending group therapy (which is often free or low-cost), or enrolling in a stress-management course."
